## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, working under the supervision of <u><strong><a href="https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr/">Prof. Hojung Cha</a></strong></u>. I am interested in building efficient on-device vision AI systems for mobile and edge computing platforms, paving the way for next-generation mobile vision AI applications such as augmented reality and autonomous systems. My core research interests include:

- **On-Device Vision AI**
- **Mobile and Edge Computing Systems**  

To address the challenges of deploying deep vision models on resource-constrained platforms, I take the following approaches:

- **AI-system co-design**: jointly optimizing AI models and system software to meet real-time latency constraints
- **Heterogeneous computing on mobile SoCs**: leveraging CPU, GPU, and NPU for efficient ML workload distribution
- **ML inference dataflow optimization**: minimizing memory movement and maximizing parallelism across compute units
