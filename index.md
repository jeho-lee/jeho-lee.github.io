## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, working under the supervision of <u><strong><a href="https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr/">Prof. Hojung Cha</a></strong></u>. My research focuses on building real-time, on-device vision AI systems for mobile and edge platforms, enabling next-generation spatial computing applications such as AR/XR and autonomous systems. My core research interests include:

- **On-Device AI** (with a primary focus on large vision models)
- **Mobile and Embedded Systems**

To address the challenges of accelerating deep vision models on resource-constrained platforms, I take the following approaches:

- **AI-system co-optimization**: jointly optimizing AI models and system software to meet real-time latency targets on given hardware, utilizing techniques like mixed-precision quantization, computation scheduling
- **Hardware-specific inference optimization**: Inference acceleration using heterogeneous processors within mobile SoCs (e.g., CPU, GPU, NPU); Inference optimizations for mobile NPUs (e.g., Hexagon NPUs) to minimize off-chip memory access and maximize parallelism
