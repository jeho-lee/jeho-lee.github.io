## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, working under the supervision of <u><strong><a href="https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr/">Prof. Hojung Cha</a></strong></u>. My research focuses on building real-time, on-device vision AI systems for mobile and edge platforms, enabling next-generation applications such as mobile augmented reality and autonomous systems. My core research interests include:

- **On-Device AI** (with a primary focus on vision AI)
- **Mobile and Embedded Systems**

To address the challenges of accelerating deep vision models on resource-constrained platforms, I take the following approaches:

- **AI-system co-design**: jointly optimizing AI models and system software to meet real-time latency constraints on target hardware
- **Heterogeneous computing on mobile SoCs**: efficient ML workload distribution across heterogeneous processors (CPU/GPU/NPU), minimizing memory movement and maximizing parallelism across compute units through dataflow optimization
