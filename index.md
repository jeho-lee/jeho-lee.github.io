## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, working under the supervision of <u><strong><a href="https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr/">Prof. Hojung Cha</a></strong></u>. I am interested in building efficient on-device vision AI systems for mobile and edge computing platforms, paving the way for next-generation mobile vision AI applications such as augmented reality and autonomous systems. My core research interests include:

**Efficient On-Device Vision AI**
  - AI-system co-design for real-time perception under hardware resource constraints

**Mobile/Edge Computing Systems**
  - Heterogeneous computing on mobile SoCs
  - ML inference dataflow scheduling and optimization
